# @nirtamir2/prettier-plugin-css-order

## Motivation
This project aims to:
- Create a package contains the stylistic order @nirtamir2 likes
  - Contains all css properties (the other orders are deprecated and not contains new css)
  - Move margins to be above height / width
- Create a prettier plugin that sort the css properties according to my order (I want to use it)
- Create a stylelint plugin that sort the css properties according to my order (because it's easy, and some people can find it helpful)
